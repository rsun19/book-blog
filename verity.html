      <p class="para">This book was a joy to read, and the way the author kept me engaged was truly skillful. 
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Summary: It's about a writer who gets a deal of a lifetime by meeting someone who's the husband of a famous writer.
        Since the wife is incapacitated, the husband gave the writer a deal to write 3 books to finish the wife's book series 
        for $500,000. Then, the writer goes to their house and reads the wife's works so that she can pick up where the wife's 
        books left off. Then, the writer reads the wife's autobiography and things take a very dark turn.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Plot: The plot was pretty dark later in the book, which I was okay with because it made the plot twist and mindfuck at the end 
        that much more mindfucky. I liked the suspense, and this was one of those books where I literally couldn't put it down.
        I liked how she used suspense, mystery, and sexual tension to carry the plot because it made the book very enjoyable to read.
        The romance also developed pretty nicely, but it got repetitive after a while. Just a warning though â€” there's a fair amount of 
        sex scenes, which get pretty spicy. But the last plot twist was crazy, I can't stress this enough! It questions the truth and after 
        reading the story, you don't know what to believe anymore. I can't even say there's an happy ending because everything is so ambiguous.

        <p class="para">Okay... so here's the real question. Team Manuscript or Team Letter? Personally, I'm Team Manuscript, because it seems
        awfully sick to write all that stuff with strikingly accurate details. For her to write that letter seemed like a cover up, and there was 
        no way that she was totally innocent. Plus, if the letter were true, the ending wouldn't have been happy, and I like happy endings. Therefore 
        I will be in denial and be on #teammanuscript.</p>
        <p class="para">Definitely one of my favorite books! I especially liked the thriller and romance 
        combo, and you cannot go wrong for choosing this book to read!</p>
