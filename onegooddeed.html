      <p class="para">As of now, this book dethroned Beach Read by Emily Henry as my new favorite book! Although
        I admit that I hate reading (or watching) works based on the past, this book is a notable exception. It
        captures the 1940s Midwestern vibe so well, including but not limited to old jargon, increased police autonomy,
        and inequalities between genders. Even the characters talk differently! I always appreciate authors doing extra
        research to give a somewhat realistic story — it makes me feel like I'm Archer himself. Plus, who doesn't love an
        ol' fashioned murder mystery? This thriller is different from most that I've read — the action isn't the main driver
        of the book, the intricacies and plot twists surrounding the murders are. But I promise, it will still be a page turner,
        if you're part of the majority that loves classic murder mysteries. Throughout the book, I audibly gasped 
        when the people who I thought committed the murders were actually innocent. Furthermore, the theories and twists were
        just so unpredictable; I felt like a conspiricy theorist while reading this book. It's just that good.

        Summary: After Aloysius Archer, a World War II vet, is released from prison, he arrives at Poca City on parole to start a 
        new life. Quickly, he found a short-term job as a debt collector for a powerful businessman, Hank Pittleman. His goal: to 
        steal a Cadillac from a stubborn shotgun-wielding madman hellbent on not paying his debt. Later, a murder took place in the 
        same hall where Archer lived, and he's the prime suspect. He's completely innocent, but how will he prove that? Will he 
        solve this mystery before the authorities arrest him? His life is on the line, and he's the only one that can save it.

        <p class="para">Wow, I truly have no words after reading this book. Everything was set up so brilliantly — literally everyone
            who had contact with Archer was put under the hot seat by David Baldacci, and no one was safe from my suspicions. At first,
            I thought Mr. Tuttle killed Hank, until he was killed himself. Then I thought Jackie did it. It made sense from the get-go and 
            the seeds of doubt were planted by Mr. Tuttle himself so it must be true, right? NOPE. Even Mrs. Crabtree was put under a microscope,
            and she was literally the most innocent person in the book! My goodness, making everyone as a suspect was mentally taxing to take in,
            but it also speaks to Baldacci's skill in concocting these outworldly theories. Truly a lost art in many books today.</p>
        <p class="para">Oh and remember the part where the detective was almost killed? I loved the sense of urgency that Baldacci slowly
            placed on Archer — as he got closer and closer to the culprit, he was more likely to get arrested. First, Archer has to get arrested 
            by the one cop he trusts, and then the cop almost dies, leaving him to fend for himself. And don't make me mention that court scene. 
            It feels so suffocating to see Archer caught in a web of lies, even when you know he's truly innocent. The last couple of pages were 
            truly the most thrilling, and it was satisfying to see the book build up to it. This is the first book I've read authored by David 
            Baldacci, and I must say, I am throughly impressed. Not bad!</p>
