      <p class="para">While I found the cover art of this book slightly provocative, I still consider 
        this book to be one of my all-time favorites. Quite frankly, I was embarrassed to show off this book 
        on the subway, and I'm absolutely positive that the librarian was silently judging me when
        I checked this book out. I'm taking off half a star right off the bat for that. For a book to
        be good, it must be readable in public.

        Summary: It all starts when the protagonist, Olive, abruptly kisses a hotshot professor in front 
        of her friend in order to portray the image that she had a boyfriend. Her friend was reluctant to 
        date Olive's ex due to their "girl code," and Olive didn't want this to happen. Unfortunately, she 
        didn't see who she was kissing, and the professor was one of the most hated on campus.
        Now, Olive is at a crossroads: will she keep up this fake relationship to ensure a relationship
        between her friend and her ex, or will she come clean to her friend?
