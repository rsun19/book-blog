    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Rating: 10/10</h3>
    <div id="para1">
      <p class="para">Now, this is what I'm talking about! Henry's other book, People We Meet On Vacation, left a bad taste in my mouth, but this one 
        is one hundred times better. How is it better, you ask? Well for one, there's an actual end goal they're working towards — creating books 
        together through shared experiences. Through these experiences, we get a first hand look into their hardships, flaws, and their deepest darkest
        secrets. It allows us to relate with the characters on a personal level, because we all have our own problems too. People We Meet On Vacation
        mostly focused on Alex and Poppy's stupid vacations together, and it's just so repetitve because there's barely any progression in the book. 
        I'm surprised if the book's timeline took more than two weeks. In Beach Read, there's meaningful progression towards their goals, and it doesn't 
        feel like a book solely focused on characters playing hard to get and being too afraid to express their feelings. When we see Gus and January's 
        relationship, we see their challenges and family problems bring them together, even though they seem so different on paper. What makes Alex and 
        Poppy so compatible? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Oh, they just spontaneously (and unrealistically) went on a few vacations and then they suddenly had an intense 
        attraction for one another? I just don't get it. Point is, Beach Read goes deeper than most romance books, and that's what makes it so great.

      <p class="para">
        Summary: After January's father died, she decided to move into his old beach house, a place that leaves her with bad memories. There, she unexpectedly
        meets her arch nemisis, Gus. Both were avid writers — Gus would write depressing literary fiction novels, while January wrote romance novels with happy
        endings. However, Gus would always outsell her, and them being neighbors meant that their friendship was inevitable. When they finally sit down together, 
        they agree on a bet: January would write depressing literary fiction novels, while Gus would write something happy, and the winner has to promote the other's 
        books. Throughout their bet, they get closer together and discover each other's secrets and bottled up memories. Who will win? Time will tell.

      <div id="spoilers">
        <p class="para">One of, if not the best book I have ever read! One small gripe about this book was that, even though most moments were really funny, some seemed
          like the author was trying too hard to be funny. Humor is something you need to sprinkle on in a book, you can't just dump it on willy nilly. Furthermore,
          I noticed that Emily Henry really loves her tranformation in the rain moments. This is fine, but it also seemed overdone. Just transform somewhere else, we
          got the point already! I also loved how wild the plot was. You're telling me that they visited former cult members and learned about how organized religion 
          created destroyed families like their own? Genius! The plot allowed them to build trust and expose each other's weaknesses so they could truly understand each 
          other. January finally understood that Gus's problems with happiness stemmed from his abusive father and his failed marriage. She tried to fix it by being there 
          for him and filling in the holes that these people left in his life. This kind of problem solving is unheard of in the past four books I've read in this genre! 
          Maybe January should work in the consulting business, who knows?</p>
        <p class="para">The last minute confession by January's father opened up a wound, which Gus closed by dancing with her in the rain. It was a great move on Emily
            Henry's part because it exemplifies the unconditional love that they have for each other. Oh, and when they finally marry at the end? Totally unexpected! I 
            thought that the chapter's name "9 Months Later" meant that she was getting pregnant! See how complex and layered the plot and their relationship is? Read both
            books, then tell me which one is better. Because I guarantee you, this one is. It's a must read for sure, and undoubtedly one of the best you will ever lay 
            your eyes on.</p>
