    <img src="tlthtm.jpg" alt="Picture of The Last Thing He Told Me by Laura Dave" class="imgsize">  
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Rating: 5/10</h3>
    <div id="para1">
      <p class="para">Frankly, this was one of the most overhyped books I have ever read, and I've read People We Meet On Vacation by
        Emily Henry. For how many ratings it has, it sucks. When I checked this book out, I couldn't help but notice the large 
        "Reese's Book Club" sticker on the cover, which really cracked me up. I want to meet the people in this club, because it's already 
        making me question the legitimacy of said club. Ok fine, I might be overreacting here — the book isn't terrible per say, just 
        extraordinarily average. Like the University of Virginia dining hall food average. It doesn't give you food poisoning, but it isn't 
        exactly a tasty meal either. I might be spoiled by the sudden twists in The One by John Marrs, but this book felt like a joke compared 
        to it. The plot was bland and underwhelming — at times, Hannah seemed paranoid, since the author consistantly failed to show the true 
        gravity of her situation. In many parts of the story, it felt as if the main characters were in a bubble, unaffected by the outside 
        world, which downplayed the urgency of their problems. Like I get that you need this "bubble" for character development, but maybe you shouldn't 
        waste my time and call this a thriller. Because it isn't, it's just a mystery book. Don't bother reading this book if you wan't some 
        adrenaline-rushing moments, because there's barely any violence, police involvement, or any sense of urgency. It's just two people investigating 
        a mystery, that's all.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Summary: When Owen Michaels is caught in a SEC scandal that could implicate him in fraud, he suddently disappears and instructs his wife, Hannah, 
        to protect their child Bailey under any circumstances. He also leaves them a black duffel bag full of cash. Neither Hannah nor Bailey knows why, 
        and they get visits from a US Marshal and two FBI agents. Hannah and Bailey then try feverishly to figure out why Owen disappeared, and they quickly 
        realize that Owen isn't who they think he is. They need to figure out who Owen really is, and why he's in trouble. Because it sounds like he's in more 
        trouble than any of them realize.

      <div id="spoilers">
        <p class="para">Out of all of the thrillers that I've ever had, this was one of the most boring, ever. You're telling me that a huge cabal hellbent on 
            getting revenge on Owen wouldn't try to kidnap Hannah or Bailey from the get-go? That they wouldn't at least make an attempt to ransom them for his 
            surrender? My goodness, the lack of action in this book made the plot super dry and vanilla, and none of their "discoveries" seemed significant. Wouldn't 
            it be fitting to have Grady killed, or to have an kidnapping attempt on Bailey to isolate them and advance the plot? I mean, Laura Dave doesn't seem like 
            a bad writer, but she should have more exciting ideas like these. Also, when Hannah was running away from Charlie in the bar, I felt that there should have 
            been more clarity on why she was running. It just made her seem so paranoid, especially since we didn't know about the super scary cabal. At least there was 
            good character development with Laura and Bailey. Despite everything, at least I'm glad that Laura and Bailey are now on good terms with each other, and 
            that Bailey knows that Laura loves her unconditionally like her father.</p>
        <p class="para">The last quarter of the book started to pick up, with Hannah finally meeting Nicholas. I liked the meeting between them and the tense atmosphere that 
            Laura Dave cultivated, and I wished that she would have done intense scenes like this throughout the book. Furthermore, the ending was heartbreaking, though I 
            liked Owen and Hannah's final goodbye, as it gave us the closure that we desperately needed. It's an unfair and bittersweet ending, but I liked the thought that 
            was put into it. It's like the author feel asleep at the wheel for 3/4 of the book, then got the inspiration she needed to finish it off. Reading this book was 
            truly a wacky experience.</p>
