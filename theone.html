      <p class="para">Oh man, reading this book was exhausting — in a good way. After every single chapter, there was a plot twist 
        of some sort; in other words, I audibly gasped every five pages. At first, I didn't like that Marrs constantly rotated between 
        5 people's POV, but it started to become intoxicating. Even though it was overwhelming in the beginning, it allowed for constant twists 
        and turns, married with constant refreshes of characters. While the main drawback of rotating through characters is decreased 
        character development, I thought that the constant twists addressed this concern fairly well. If a plot twist happens every 5 
        pages, character devopment obviously runs its course faster. Consequently, the story also moved much faster, which kept me on my toes. 
        Honestly, I loved this sudden change of pace, and would love for authors to copy this book's layout. One gripe I had with this book 
        was its ending, which I will discuss later in the review. Nonetheless, if you're looking for a thriller, this one will not disappoint!

        Summary: Match Your DNA, a multibillion dollar corporation, discovered a gene that could match people based on a preconcieved 
        genetic link. Thus, if you find a partner on this platform, you're guaranteed to be their soulmate. At least, that's the promise 
        that you're given. As a result of this moneymaking scheme, people have torn apart families, deserted dating apps, and even murdered 
        each other. In this book, we look at this through the lens of five people, who have been matched based on this platform. But it turns 
        out, your match might not be what you're expecting, and even soulmates can be murderous lunatics. But still, in theory, it should help 
        more people than not, right? Well, that's what you'll find out later in this book.

        <p class="para">This book was honestly one of the craziest books I have ever read, because it has gotten so bold so quickly, playing
            on worst-case senarios for relationships. From serial killers to cancer, these characters never catch a break, which sometimes 
            annoyed me. The plot development was almost always the same for everyone: build up their relationships to euphoric levels, then 
            crash them back to earth. But alas, I can never fault the book for that, because as it turns out, these worst-case scenarios always 
            make for the best plot twists, and reading this book honestly felt like I was hooked on heroin (I wouldn't know though, I swear). I blazed 
            through the pages, always looking towards what happened next, and it never disappointed me. The only characters who deserves a good 
            ending are Amy, Mandy, Jade, and Nick, because they're the only genuine people in the book. The sad part is — Mandy's ending was left much 
            to be desired for. Like I know this isn't a stupid Disney movie where you can bring someone back to life by holding their hand, but 
            still, she went through a lot. Anyways, the author has made a lot of bold choices throughout the book (which I sometimes don't agree with),
            but I can't deny the fact that it has contributed a net positive in this book. Who could have forsaw Amy murdering Chris or Sally dying
            with the baby? That's right, nobody!</p>
        <p class="para">I was amazed on how derailed everyone's lives were in the ending. I'm a sucker for happy Hallmark cards-esque endings, and 
            this one hurts the soul. That's why I removed a point off the rating. If you think that's not fair, well too bad :). I really wanted Marrs 
            to put in at least one character who had happy results with this program, but alas once you commit 5 characters to this shitshow, you really 
            have to go all the way. Anyways, I 100% would recommend this book to everyone, but I can see how this could be a hit or miss with some people. The 
            endings, while crazy, were still depressing and a commentary on the absolute worst relationships ever.</p>
